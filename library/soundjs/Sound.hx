/**
 * The Sound class is the public API for creating sounds, controlling the overall sound levels, and managing plugins.
 * All Sound APIs on this class are static.
 * 
 * <b>Registering and Preloading</b><br />
 * Before you can play a sound, it <b>must</b> be registered. You can do this with {{#crossLink "Sound/registerSound"}}{{/crossLink}},
 * or register multiple sounds using {{#crossLink "Sound/registerSounds"}}{{/crossLink}}. If you don't register a
 * sound prior to attempting to play it using {{#crossLink "Sound/play"}}{{/crossLink}} or create it using {{#crossLink "Sound/createInstance"}}{{/crossLink}},
 * the sound source will be automatically registered but playback will fail as the source will not be ready. If you use
 * <a href="http://preloadjs.com" target="_blank">PreloadJS</a>, registration is handled for you when the sound is
 * preloaded. It is recommended to preload sounds either internally using the register functions or externally using
 * PreloadJS so they are ready when you want to use them.
 * 
 * <b>Playback</b><br />
 * To play a sound once it's been registered and preloaded, use the {{#crossLink "Sound/play"}}{{/crossLink}} method.
 * This method returns a {{#crossLink "AbstractSoundInstance"}}{{/crossLink}} which can be paused, resumed, muted, etc.
 * Please see the {{#crossLink "AbstractSoundInstance"}}{{/crossLink}} documentation for more on the instance control APIs.
 * 
 * <b>Plugins</b><br />
 * By default, the {{#crossLink "WebAudioPlugin"}}{{/crossLink}} or the {{#crossLink "HTMLAudioPlugin"}}{{/crossLink}}
 * are used (when available), although developers can change plugin priority or add new plugins (such as the
 * provided {{#crossLink "FlashAudioPlugin"}}{{/crossLink}}). Please see the {{#crossLink "Sound"}}{{/crossLink}} API
 * methods for more on the playback and plugin APIs. To install plugins, or specify a different plugin order, see
 * {{#crossLink "Sound/installPlugins"}}{{/crossLink}}.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * 
 *      createjs.FlashAudioPlugin.swfPath = "../src/soundjs/flashaudio";
 *      createjs.Sound.registerPlugins([createjs.WebAudioPlugin, createjs.FlashAudioPlugin]);
 *      createjs.Sound.alternateExtensions = ["mp3"];
 *      createjs.Sound.on("fileload", this.loadHandler, this);
 *      createjs.Sound.registerSound("path/to/mySound.ogg", "sound");
 *      function loadHandler(event) {
 *          // This is fired for each sound that is registered.
 *          var instance = createjs.Sound.play("sound");  // play using id.  Could also use full source path or event.src.
 *          instance.on("complete", this.handleComplete, this);
 *          instance.volume = 0.5;
 *      }
 * 
 * The maximum number of concurrently playing instances of the same sound can be specified in the "data" argument
 * of {{#crossLink "Sound/registerSound"}}{{/crossLink}}.  Note that if not specified, the active plugin will apply
 * a default limit.  Currently HTMLAudioPlugin sets a default limit of 2, while WebAudioPlugin and FlashAudioPlugin set a
 * default limit of 100.
 * 
 *      createjs.Sound.registerSound("sound.mp3", "soundId", 4);
 * 
 * Sound can be used as a plugin with PreloadJS to help preload audio properly. Audio preloaded with PreloadJS is
 * automatically registered with the Sound class. When audio is not preloaded, Sound will do an automatic internal
 * load. As a result, it may fail to play the first time play is called if the audio is not finished loading. Use
 * the {{#crossLink "Sound/fileload:event"}}{{/crossLink}} event to determine when a sound has finished internally
 * preloading. It is recommended that all audio is preloaded before it is played.
 * 
 *      var queue = new createjs.LoadQueue();
 * 		queue.installPlugin(createjs.Sound);
 * 
 * <b>Audio Sprites</b><br />
 * SoundJS has added support for {{#crossLink "AudioSprite"}}{{/crossLink}}, available as of version 0.6.0.
 * For those unfamiliar with audio sprites, they are much like CSS sprites or sprite sheets: multiple audio assets
 * grouped into a single file.
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * 
 * 		var assetsPath = "./assets/";
 * 		var sounds = [{
 * 			src:"MyAudioSprite.ogg", data: {
 * 				audioSprite: [
 * 					{id:"sound1", startTime:0, duration:500},
 * 					{id:"sound2", startTime:1000, duration:400},
 * 					{id:"sound3", startTime:1700, duration: 1000}
 * 				]}
 * 			}
 * 		];
 * 		createjs.Sound.alternateExtensions = ["mp3"];
 * 		createjs.Sound.on("fileload", loadSound);
 * 		createjs.Sound.registerSounds(sounds, assetsPath);
 * 		// after load is complete
 * 		createjs.Sound.play("sound2");
 * 
 * <b>Mobile Playback</b><br />
 * Devices running iOS require the WebAudio context to be "unlocked" by playing at least one sound inside of a user-
 * initiated event (such as touch/click). Earlier versions of SoundJS included a "MobileSafe" sample, but this is no
 * longer necessary as of SoundJS 0.6.2.
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         In SoundJS 0.4.1 and above, you can either initialize plugins or use the {{#crossLink "WebAudioPlugin/playEmptySound"}}{{/crossLink}}
 *         method in the call stack of a user input event to manually unlock the audio context.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         In SoundJS 0.6.2 and above, SoundJS will automatically listen for the first document-level "mousedown"
 *         and "touchend" event, and unlock WebAudio. This will continue to check these events until the WebAudio
 *         context becomes "unlocked" (changes from "suspended" to "running")
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Both the "mousedown" and "touchend" events can be used to unlock audio in iOS9+, the "touchstart" event
 *         will work in iOS8 and below. The "touchend" event will only work in iOS9 when the gesture is interpreted
 *         as a "click", so if the user long-presses the button, it will no longer work.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         When using the <a href="http://www.createjs.com/docs/easeljs/classes/Touch.html">EaselJS Touch class</a>,
 *         the "mousedown" event will not fire when a canvas is clicked, since MouseEvents are prevented, to ensure
 *         only touch events fire. To get around this, you can either rely on "touchend", or:
 *         <ol>
 *             <li>Set the `allowDefault` property on the Touch class constructor to `true` (defaults to `false`).</li>
 *             <li>Set the `preventSelection` property on the EaselJS `Stage` to `false`.</li>
 *         </ol>
 *         These settings may change how your application behaves, and are not recommended.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <b>Loading Alternate Paths and Extension-less Files</b><br />
 * SoundJS supports loading alternate paths and extension-less files by passing an object instead of a string for
 * the `src` property, which is a hash using the format `{extension:"path", extension2:"path2"}`. These labels are
 * how SoundJS determines if the browser will support the sound. This also enables multiple formats to live in
 * different folders, or on CDNs, which often has completely different filenames for each file.
 * 
 * Priority is determined by the property order (first property is tried first).  This is supported by both internal loading
 * and loading with PreloadJS.
 * 
 * <em>Note: an id is required for playback.</em>
 * 
 * <h4>Example</h4>
 * 
 * 		var sounds = {path:"./audioPath/",
 * 				manifest: [
 * 				{id: "cool", src: {mp3:"mp3/awesome.mp3", ogg:"noExtensionOggFile"}}
 * 		]};
 * 
 * 		createjs.Sound.alternateExtensions = ["mp3"];
 * 		createjs.Sound.addEventListener("fileload", handleLoad);
 * 		createjs.Sound.registerSounds(sounds);
 * 
 * <h3>Known Browser and OS issues</h3>
 * <b>IE 9 HTML Audio limitations</b><br />
 * <ul><li>There is a delay in applying volume changes to tags that occurs once playback is started. So if you have
 * muted all sounds, they will all play during this delay until the mute applies internally. This happens regardless of
 * when or how you apply the volume change, as the tag seems to need to play to apply it.</li>
 * <li>MP3 encoding will not always work for audio tags, particularly in Internet Explorer. We've found default
 * encoding with 64kbps works.</li>
 * <li>Occasionally very short samples will get cut off.</li>
 * <li>There is a limit to how many audio tags you can load and play at once, which appears to be determined by
 * hardware and browser settings.  See {{#crossLink "HTMLAudioPlugin.MAX_INSTANCES"}}{{/crossLink}} for a safe
 * estimate.</li></ul>
 * 
 * <b>Firefox 25 Web Audio limitations</b>
 * <ul><li>mp3 audio files do not load properly on all windows machines, reported
 * <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=929969" target="_blank">here</a>. </br>
 * For this reason it is recommended to pass another FF supported type (ie ogg) first until this bug is resolved, if
 * possible.</li></ul>
 * 
 * <b>Safari limitations</b><br />
 * <ul><li>Safari requires Quicktime to be installed for audio playback.</li></ul>
 * 
 * <b>iOS 6 Web Audio limitations</b><br />
 * <ul><li>Sound is initially locked, and must be unlocked via a user-initiated event. Please see the section on
 * Mobile Playback above.</li>
 * <li>A bug exists that will distort un-cached web audio when a video element is present in the DOM that has audio
 * at a different sampleRate.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <b>Android HTML Audio limitations</b><br />
 * <ul><li>We have no control over audio volume. Only the user can set volume on their device.</li>
 * <li>We can only play audio inside a user event (touch/click).  This currently means you cannot loop sound or use
 * a delay.</li></ul>
 * 
 * <b>Web Audio and PreloadJS</b><br />
 * <ul><li>Web Audio must be loaded through XHR, therefore when used with PreloadJS, tag loading is not possible.
 * This means that tag loading can not be used to avoid cross domain issues.</li><ul>
