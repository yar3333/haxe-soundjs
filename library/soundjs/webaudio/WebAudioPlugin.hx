/**
 * Play sounds using Web Audio in the browser. The WebAudioPlugin is currently the default plugin, and will be used
 * anywhere that it is supported. To change plugin priority, check out the Sound API
 * {{#crossLink "Sound/registerPlugins"}}{{/crossLink}} method.
 * 
 * <h4>Known Browser and OS issues for Web Audio</h4>
 * <b>Firefox 25</b>
 * <li>
 *     mp3 audio files do not load properly on all windows machines, reported <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=929969" target="_blank">here</a>.
 *     <br />For this reason it is recommended to pass another FireFox-supported type (i.e. ogg) as the default
 *     extension, until this bug is resolved
 * </li>
 * 
 * <b>Webkit (Chrome and Safari)</b>
 * <li>
 *     AudioNode.disconnect does not always seem to work.  This can cause the file size to grow over time if you
 * 	   are playing a lot of audio files.
 * </li>
 * 
 * <b>iOS 6 limitations</b>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         Sound is initially muted and will only unmute through play being called inside a user initiated event
 *         (touch/click). Please read the mobile playback notes in the the {{#crossLink "Sound"}}{{/crossLink}}
 *         class for a full overview of the limitations, and how to get around them.
 *     </li>
 * 	   <li>
 * 	       A bug exists that will distort un-cached audio when a video element is present in the DOM. You can avoid
 * 	       this bug by ensuring the audio and video audio share the same sample rate.
 * 	   </li>
 * </ul>
