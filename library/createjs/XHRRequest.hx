 * A preloader that loads items using XHR requests, usually XMLHttpRequest. However XDomainRequests will be used
 * for cross-domain requests if possible, and older versions of IE fall back on to ActiveX objects when necessary.
 * XHR requests load the content as text or binary data, provide progress and consistent completion events, and
 * can be canceled during load. Note that XHR is not supported in IE 6 or earlier, and is not recommended for
 * cross-domain loading.
